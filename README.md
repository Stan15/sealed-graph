# sealed-graph
An efficient sealed graph data structure.
Couple helpful algorithms implemented.
Optimized algorithms are made possible by the graph being sealed and unmodifiable.
 - such algorithms as iterating through the topological levels of a dependency graph, to enable parallelization of computation across non-dependent items
